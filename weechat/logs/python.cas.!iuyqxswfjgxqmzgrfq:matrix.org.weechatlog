2021-02-19 19:57:46	@brenbarn	I dunno what your setup is like but if you have some devops or sysadmin guys controlling the installed version I would think you'd need to make a case for why you need a particular version
2021-02-19 20:14:01	sage_	does python have an event lib? (subscriber/observer)
2021-02-20 03:39:30	seansummers	... there's a few batteries included in hashlib
2021-02-20 03:40:29	foxehbunneh	interesting
2021-02-20 03:40:51	seansummers	I think so. :-)
2021-02-20 03:41:45	foxehbunneh	I basically at some point wanted to take the sort of seed generator, and make a sort of visual matrix with it. Actually I had a bit of a game idea, but wanted to test a visual representation of how it would be implemented first.
2021-02-20 03:43:39	foxehbunneh	Basically I was gonna try a 'galaxy-economy' game simulator thing, where a seed-generated galaxy is created with stars that have a subset of variables extracted from the same seed, with planets that go another layer deep, for variation.
2021-02-20 03:45:31	seansummers	You might like this: http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/projects/validation/validation.pdf
2021-02-20 03:45:31		... but I'm probably thinking a little differently than a level generation seed.
2021-02-20 03:46:43	foxehbunneh	yea this seems to go down the pathway of encryption, which is probably an even more valueable use of the sort of principle of what I'm doing lol
2021-02-20 03:47:15	foxehbunneh	long time ago I wanted to do a key encryption/decryption program, back when I knew nothing of code.
2021-02-20 03:47:54	@brenbarn	heh I remember doing that in QBasic when I was a kid
2021-02-20 03:48:00	@brenbarn	it was rudimentary to say the least
2021-02-20 03:48:20	seansummers	This one might be interesting (and in need of an update): https://github.com/luxcem/vizhash
2021-02-20 03:49:30	foxehbunneh	Lol and I called mine VizMat, and it looks extremely similar to what I'm trying to do lol
2021-02-20 03:50:00	foxehbunneh	to be fair tho I had literally no clue what to name it xD
2021-02-20 03:52:17	seansummers	Okay, I finally found the paper I was looking for (it's about the ssh randomart fingerprint algorithm): http://www.dirk-loss.de/sshvis/drunken_bishop.pdf
2021-02-20 03:54:25	foxehbunneh	that's interesting how they get that visual matrix out of the fingerprint
2021-02-20 03:54:44	foxehbunneh	<Screenshot from 2021-02-19 21-54-33.png> [https://office.codeandsoda.hu:443/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/XmqXzBFaTNqHKgnPPakzbelI]
2021-02-20 03:55:50	foxehbunneh	wonder if it has to match a certain % of characters, or if it has a high enough tolerance in the sensors themselves for same fingerprints to get same values close to 100% of the time
2021-02-20 03:56:18	foxehbunneh	unless fingerprint is metaphorical and I'm a dumbass lol
2021-02-20 03:57:12	seansummers	'fingerprint'  is cryptospeak for a hash. It's just easier to handle than the original (being smaller), but prone to collisions.
2021-02-20 03:57:29	seansummers	You might think of it as a checksum.
2021-02-20 03:58:09	foxehbunneh	ah I see
2021-02-20 04:02:00	seansummers	Actually, it's almost the inverse of a seed. If you take a fingerprint of something, you want it to be difficult for someone to create a seed that generates something with the same fingerprint.

2021-02-20 04:06:11	foxehbunneh	that's quite interesting
2021-02-20 04:06:48	foxehbunneh	it's basically making the seed into an abstraction to verify instead of the simple characters themselves

2021-02-20 10:05:32		How should I transform this to get the contents of multiple urls concurrently?
2021-02-20 10:06:09	foxehbunneh	Oh boi, another web scraper lol
2021-02-20 10:06:21	@brenbarn	have you looked at scrapy?  depending on what you're doing that may be a better approach
2021-02-20 10:10:56	pkarpesis	is scrapy async?
2021-02-20 10:10:59	foxehbunneh	I have a whole scraper program that you can use as reference in bs4, but bare in mind it's the first python code I ever wrote
2021-02-20 10:11:04	foxehbunneh	https://codeshare.io/a34P8B
2021-02-20 10:11:31	pkarpesis	I definetely need async to integrate with aiohttp
2021-02-20 10:17:05	pkarpesis	also question was related to to async in general. How would you get get_site_content for multiple urls . For example how would this:
2021-02-20 10:17:05		                                    
2021-02-20 10:17:05		  urls = ['url1.com, `url2.com`]    
2021-02-20 10:17:05		  for url in urls:                  
2021-02-20 10:17:05		      print(get_site_content(url))  
2021-02-20 10:17:05		                                    
2021-02-20 10:17:05		                                    
2021-02-20 10:17:05		run concurrently for all urls ?
2021-02-20 10:20:37	foxehbunneh	Well that would run it systematically for each link. So you would have your scraper program whatever data you're trying to pull, pull from each link like it was doing just one, but because it's in the loop it'll do each item.
2021-02-20 10:23:11	pkarpesis	foxehbunneh: what do you mean by systematically ? Do you mean that this will run in sequentially?
2021-02-20 10:24:16	pkarpesis	* foxehbunneh: what do you mean by systematically ? Do you mean that this will run sequentially?
2021-02-20 10:24:21	foxehbunneh	Yes, so you would presumably have your scraper pull from the data from the first link and do whatever you write in your loop, then after that loop is finished it'll do the next one on the list the exact same as the first.
2021-02-20 10:25:07	foxehbunneh	Anything inside that loop how it's written will happen again and again until it's out of listed items, basically
2021-02-20 10:26:10	foxehbunneh	But I'm assuming you're asking how to get the actual html stuff inside each link?
2021-02-20 10:27:45	@brenbarn	scrapy can run multiple parallel jobs
2021-02-20 10:29:35	agentsmith6969	hammering a site with multiple parallel requests is not nice anyway
2021-02-20 10:29:47	agentsmith6969	this is more for fetching data from multiple sites

2021-02-20 10:29:58		> stuff inside each link?
2021-02-20 10:29:58		well yes would like to get all Beautifulsoup objects retrieved in parallel

2021-02-20 10:30:09		this is true!
2021-02-20 10:30:29	foxehbunneh	I add a time delay for each request, as to not ddos
2021-02-20 10:30:40	pkarpesis	but would like to know the proper way, for multiple sites maybe
2021-02-20 10:30:46	agentsmith6969	I believe the original HTTP spec recommends no more than 2 concurrent connections to a site from a client

2021-02-20 10:30:57		can you give me some sample code pleaes?
2021-02-20 10:31:01	agentsmith6969	one fetching the HTML document and one fetching resources from it, like images

2021-02-20 10:31:15	foxehbunneh	https://codeshare.io/a34P8B
2021-02-20 10:31:30	foxehbunneh	There's a lot here not relevent to your site specifically
2021-02-20 10:32:15	foxehbunneh	but look around 49-56 for the actual html parsing
2021-02-20 10:32:27	foxehbunneh	within the loop, which looks like what you're doing so far
2021-02-20 10:33:02	foxehbunneh	you'd also need the imports from line 4 and 5
2021-02-20 10:34:56	foxehbunneh	See the majority of my code for that is messy because I had to do a bunch of splicing from the links not actually displaying correctly on the site, so when I pulled from links within those links, it didn't work as is. But if all the data you want is inside the links you list right there, then all you have to do is parse through the html and look for the right class of stuff you're looking for.
2021-02-20 10:35:17	agentsmith6969	boris: https://www.last.fm/api 😂
2021-02-20 10:35:24	foxehbunneh	Oh and remember to keep test printing line by line to make sure you're getting the right info
2021-02-20 10:35:44	agentsmith6969	your chances to get banned for scraping that site just increased, since the site has an API
2021-02-20 10:36:00	foxehbunneh	hm
2021-02-20 10:36:08	foxehbunneh	yea that might make things difficult
2021-02-20 10:36:28	agentsmith6969	also, screw that proprietary service, use musicbrainz instead!
2021-02-20 10:36:51	foxehbunneh	I'd put loooong time.sleep() commands from import time library in there
2021-02-20 10:36:59	foxehbunneh	at the end of each loop
2021-02-20 10:37:17	agentsmith6969	https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database#Download
2021-02-20 10:37:40	foxehbunneh	or you could just use that lol
2021-02-20 10:38:15	foxehbunneh	but still, use a little delay just to be courteous.
2021-02-20 10:40:05	foxehbunneh	Oh also how do you do the little code box thing? In Element.
2021-02-20 10:40:25	foxehbunneh	I've seen others do it I just have no clue how to do it lol

2021-02-20 19:19:21	agentsmith6969	if it works differently on different OSes, you'll end with different directory hashes

2021-02-20 19:57:34	krazykirby99999	ty, i will modify my code
2021-02-20 19:58:01	seansummers	Python makes it easy to not care about things like this, until unfortunately you do.
2021-02-20 19:58:10	krazykirby99999	indeed
2021-02-20 19:58:29	seansummers	But it doesn't get in the way of letting you solve it either.
2021-02-20 20:00:41	seansummers	My experience is that taking a step back and asking a why (or 5) is appropriate at times like these. Not because this is an xy problem, but because technical debt is guaranteed to increase over time no matter how you take the first steps.
2021-02-20 20:01:44	krazykirby99999	ok
2021-02-20 20:01:52	seansummers	In this case, your io buffer isn't the resource that will starve first, even though you engineered it for success.
2021-02-20 20:02:21	krazykirby99999	you are right, the memory would be consumed from the file_data variable instead of the io buffer
2021-02-20 20:02:27	krazykirby99999	it would have made no difference
2021-02-20 20:02:37	krazykirby99999	now it no longer will do that

2021-02-20 20:14:26	seansummers	Yes.
2021-02-20 20:14:44	agentsmith6969	TBH it shouldn't be used explicitly, but it makes sense to set it as pre-commit hook
2021-02-20 20:14:50	seansummers	I am suggesting it for krazykirby99999
2021-02-20 20:14:52	agentsmith6969	that way you can keep writing ugly code
2021-02-20 20:15:02	krazykirby99999	i use autopep8
2021-02-20 20:16:58	seansummers	It should catch things like L26-27 where you have a variable named `dir`
2021-02-20 20:16:58		Which, to borrow agentsmith6969  's term, looks "ugly" to me.
2021-02-20 20:17:09	krazykirby99999	ok
2021-02-20 20:17:44	seansummers	I forget sometimes but always like to know when I accidentally redefine a python built-in.
2021-02-20 20:18:02	krazykirby99999	i checked, and it is not catching it
2021-02-20 20:18:09	krazykirby99999	i will manually change it, ty
2021-02-20 20:18:45	seansummers	It's harder to shoot yourself in your foot these days, but once True/False were scary to use in the steam powered python days of old.
2021-02-20 20:19:41	agentsmith6969	Sean Summers: I used 'ugly' as in 'not conforming to certain coding standards but rather to own habits'
2021-02-20 20:21:42	seansummers	Yeah, I think I feel you there. I prefer to chisel away at my self worth until I fix my bad habits rather than ignore them. But that means I get mad at my editor a lot too.
2021-02-20 20:22:30	seansummers	Like, who needs brace matching in python? Seriously.
2021-02-20 20:23:43	seansummers	If I want to start my strings with 3 quotes, I shouldn't have to have finger to cursor combat every time.
2021-02-20 20:24:20	agentsmith6969	I used to know a girl who used 3-space indent levels in Python code for a couple of years
2021-02-20 20:24:59	agentsmith6969	was never a problem for her (she wasn't a programmer, but had a PhD and worked in biotech)
2021-02-20 20:25:12	agentsmith6969	wasn't a problem for other biotech dudes, since they weren't programmers either
2021-02-20 20:27:11	seansummers	I have a habit of 2, which reminds me to tab convert when I have to publish anything.
2021-02-20 20:29:41	agentsmith6969	coding standards are good, as soon as code starts getting shared
2021-02-20 20:29:55	agentsmith6969	smaller diffs are good

2021-02-21 15:16:39	skye0	Hello, I'm trying to understand how this function works:

2021-02-21 15:16:39		      ("Product2", 9),

2021-02-21 15:16:39		                                        
2021-02-21 15:16:39		  items.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])  
2021-02-21 15:16:39		  print(items)

2021-02-21 15:16:39		I'll ask about lambda functions in a bit (since I also am quite new to them), but I'm wondering how item works, how Python knows that the code should return tuple indices of individual list items and not list indices.
2021-02-21 15:17:31	skye0	I'm using video tutorials from codewithmosh.com (paid for a lifetime cost when it was heavily discounted, and preferred my learning to be structured instead of me potentially going through rabbit hole and being easily daunted by them)
2021-02-21 16:47:55	«	@u5g0vxvo1m5erstrobsote:matrix.org (None) has left #Python
2021-02-21 17:50:44	seansummers	@skye0, you are asking about item in the lambda on line 8?
2021-02-21 17:51:09	skye0	yes, the one without the square brackets
2021-02-21 17:51:33	seansummers	that's just the argument list for the anonymous function (aka, "lambda")
2021-02-21 17:52:16	seansummers	For instance, you could use:
2021-02-21 17:52:16		items.sort(key=lambda key, value: value)
2021-02-21 17:53:09	skye0	the non-lambda version of the function I believe is:
2021-02-21 17:53:09		                       
2021-02-21 17:53:09		  def get_item(item):  
2021-02-21 17:53:09		      return item[1]   
2021-02-21 17:53:09		                       
2021-02-21 17:53:09		                       
2021-02-21 17:53:09		
2021-02-21 17:53:09		i'm trying to get my head around how python knows that it should use the tuple as a key
2021-02-21 17:53:11	seansummers	well, conceptually. i'm not able to tuple unpack that
2021-02-21 17:53:34	seansummers	do you know what items[0] returns?
2021-02-21 17:54:02	seansummers	because, that is what is passed to the key
2021-02-21 17:54:25	skye0	it should return the name of the item. it's just quite baffling to me how python does this
2021-02-21 17:54:40	seansummers	name?
2021-02-21 17:54:52	skye0	"Product 1" for instance
2021-02-21 17:55:16	seansummers	no, that's the first value in a tuple of ('Product 1', 10)
2021-02-21 17:55:26	seansummers	You didn't tell python anything about this "name" you speak of
2021-02-21 17:56:19	seansummers	items is a list of tuples. Your tuples are all 2 values. items is of length 3, so key gets called 3 times.
2021-02-21 17:56:27	skye0	this is where i'm trying to infer how python knows that it needs to sort a tuple with sort() instead of a list item
2021-02-21 17:56:42	seansummers	* items is a list of tuples. Your tuples are all 2 values. items is of length 3, so key gets called 3 times, by the list.sort method
2021-02-21 17:57:01	seansummers	To understand that, you need to know what your list items are.
2021-02-21 17:57:17	seansummers	items[0] is what will be passed to key for the first invocation, right?
2021-02-21 17:57:33	seansummers	and I think you misunderstand what items[0] evaluates to
2021-02-21 17:58:37	skye0	what would it evaluate to?
2021-02-21 17:58:52	seansummers	Do you have a python cli you can execute?
2021-02-21 17:59:04	skye0	i'll bring one up
2021-02-21 17:59:10	seansummers	Your code executes fine when I past it here.
2021-02-21 17:59:13	seansummers	 * Your code executes fine when I paste it here.
2021-02-21 17:59:29	skye0	it does execute fine, i'm just trying to understand how it works
2021-02-21 17:59:32	seansummers	I'm just running python 3.9, which removed lambda tuple unpacking (long live the BDFL)
2021-02-21 17:59:43	seansummers	yes, so now execute items[0]
2021-02-21 18:00:11	seansummers	Hint: it does not return "Product 1"
2021-02-21 18:00:20	seansummers	* Hint: it does not return "Product1"
2021-02-21 18:01:10	seansummers	* Hint: it does not return 'Product1'
2021-02-21 18:03:21	skye0	The lambda functions print something like this:
2021-02-21 18:03:21		                                             
2021-02-21 18:03:21		  <function <lambda> at 0x000001EF5590BCA0>  
2021-02-21 18:03:21		  <function <lambda> at 0x000002D9FB1FBD30>  
2021-02-21 18:03:21		                                             
2021-02-21 18:03:21		                                             
2021-02-21 18:03:21		
2021-02-21 18:03:21		But if I don't use a lambda function, I get something like this:
2021-02-21 18:03:21		                    
2021-02-21 18:03:21		  ('Product1', 10)  
2021-02-21 18:03:21		                    
2021-02-21 18:03:21		                    
2021-02-21 18:03:21		
2021-02-21 18:03:52	seansummers	Yes, the lambda function is just like your get_item function above.
2021-02-21 18:04:17	seansummers	You have to add () to your <function <lambda> at ...> eval to get it to execute
2021-02-21 18:04:50	seansummers	So, you understand that the first item in your items list is ('Product1', 10), right?
2021-02-21 18:04:56	seansummers	* So, you understand that the first item in your items list is the tuple ('Product1', 10), right?
2021-02-21 18:05:17	skye0	I believe so
2021-02-21 18:05:51	seansummers	So, instead of just a locale sort, you can give a callable to the key argument of the list.sort function.
2021-02-21 18:06:09	seansummers	It will be called for each item, to return the thing that should be used for the locale sort.
2021-02-21 18:06:36	seansummers	Do you know what evaluating that item[1] returns?
2021-02-21 18:07:12	skye0	('Product2', 9)?
2021-02-21 18:07:16	seansummers	For inspiration, try:
2021-02-21 18:07:16		[item[1] for item in items]
2021-02-21 18:10:03	skye0	[10, 9, 12]
2021-02-21 18:10:03		I understand this a little bit easier, but what's the significance of the outer square brackets in that, considering one can use regular brackets to divide if statements?
2021-02-21 18:11:01	seansummers	I find reading out python helps me write better code.
2021-02-21 18:11:19	seansummers	I'd read what you pasted as:
2021-02-21 18:11:19		> A list of the integers, 10, 9 and 12.
2021-02-21 18:11:38	skye0	that's what i got from print([item[1] for item in items]
2021-02-21 18:11:45	seansummers	The square brackets are python's hint to me that this is a list data structure.
2021-02-21 18:12:08	seansummers	Meaning, I can pass it to anything expecting a listlike object.
2021-02-21 18:12:50	skye0	ok, it just looks unconventional to me since the items aren't separated by commas
2021-02-21 18:13:02	seansummers	To answer your last question, the significance of the square brackets is that the python cli is trying to tell me that is returning a list object.
2021-02-21 18:13:18	seansummers	⁉️ Where are you missing commas?
2021-02-21 18:16:04	skye0	oh, lists to me normally look like a set of values separated by commas. this threw me off somewhat, but thanks for explaining
2021-02-21 18:16:44	seansummers	I'm not sure where you see commas missing here. There are two in the list of [10, 9, 12]
2021-02-21 18:17:40	skye0	oh, i was just confused when i saw the list without commas because i didn't know that lists could be created like that, and when i see brackets, i normally consider them as separators for logic
2021-02-21 18:17:49	seansummers	And to clarify, lists are specifically python objects, represented as separated by commas and surrounded by square brackets.
2021-02-21 18:18:43	seansummers	I think I'm still missing you. "created like that" is which line? And yes, undersanding that square brackets are defining a list or a list comprehension are very python specific.
2021-02-21 18:21:12	seansummers	And we may have a confusing involving the syntax for the intention of subscripting/slicing, which uses the square brackets as an operator
2021-02-21 18:21:21	seansummers	 * And we may have a confusion involving the syntax for the intention of subscripting/slicing, which uses the square brackets as an operator
2021-02-21 18:22:07	seansummers	But as a rule, python avoids using "separators for logic" other than whitespace.
2021-02-21 18:24:14	seansummers	Your initial question uses brackets as a delimiter and operator, and you also have parenthesis, which are for tuples, which are similar to lists. So there's a lot going on if you want to keep exploring.
2021-02-21 18:25:38	skye0	so from what i understand, sort in sort(key, reverse) runs:
2021-02-21 18:25:38		for item in items in part, with key being the item in the for loop?
2021-02-21 18:27:13	seansummers	I'd say "yes", but to rephrase: The sort method of the list object, by default uses  the items in the list as the key to rearrange the item order in place.
2021-02-21 18:27:23	seansummers	* I'd say "yes", but to rephrase: The sort method of the list object, by default uses  the items in the list as the key to rearrange the item order in place.
2021-02-21 18:27:57	seansummers	This behavior can be redefined by passing a key to the sort method.
2021-02-21 18:28:11	skye0	ok, thanks for your explanation
2021-02-21 18:29:26	seansummers	Since passing a constant key in won't do anything (already constant sorted), you have to pass some executable code that might clue the sort into doing some work.
2021-02-21 18:30:07	seansummers	The executable will get the default value for key passed in as an argument.
2021-02-21 18:30:30	seansummers	You provided a lambda that returns the second value of that as the final key.
2021-02-21 19:27:12	krbonne	hi all

2021-02-22 01:55:35		You could use GH actions (or do it locally before pushing with hooks or so) to "compile" something to md (or maybe html?) file. Maybe it is possible to squash it, if you use actions.
2021-02-22 01:55:35		IDK, would be super hacky.
2021-02-22 01:55:35		If that would be an option for you, have a look at a program called pandoc. I'm doing things like that by copy/paste before every release.

2021-02-24 12:31:54	sasha-jen	Hi guys. I've resumed learning python this week after trying it out for 2 weeks last autumn as my first programming language. I'm currently wrapping my head around everything being an object and the 3 base attributes all objects must have are: identity, value & type.
2021-02-24 12:31:54		The question I have right this instant is that if functions and classes are objects themselves, what does their value refer to? Is their value everything indented within them? Are they self-referring variables like "2" is its own identifier and value (2 = 2)? Meaning the value of classes and objects is the name you've given them?

2021-02-24 12:44:14	&michael	Classes are made of dicts, which are made of lists in lists and a list (or tuples of tuples, if you used __slots__) and lists of hashes. Even an empty source file is basically a class.

2021-02-24 18:09:03	krbonne	n2=treenode(n1)
2021-02-24 18:09:32	krbonne	question: am I correct to assume that n2.up (which is n1) then only contains a POINTER to n1!
2021-02-24 18:09:39	krbonne	(and hence not n1 itself)
2021-02-24 18:10:32	krbonne	this is to know the memory requirements ... is the treenode.up is just a pointer, that is OK
2021-02-24 18:11:02	krbonne	if treenode.up would contain the complete object, this means that the memory requirements is completely different 
2021-02-24 18:11:10	krbonne	if you have a big tree
2021-02-24 18:19:46	remuladgryta	correct. it's just a reference, not a copy.
2021-02-24 18:21:42	remuladgryta	you can verify this yourself by modifying n1 and seeing the changes reflected in n2.up
2021-02-24 18:33:14	krbonne	hij .. ok .. thx :-)
2021-02-24 18:33:55	krbonne	I was looking for a function that given in idea of how much memory something uses
2021-02-24 18:36:05	krbonne	there is a function sizeof but that did not change if I had one element in my data list of 1000
2021-02-24 18:36:15	krbonne	so I guess that was not the correct function
2021-02-24 18:36:31	krbonne	_ _ sizeof _ _
2021-02-24 18:37:11	krbonne	(element seems to replace the twice _ by a 'make bold' ) 
2021-02-24 18:39:57	seansummers	I see
2021-02-24 18:42:42	seansummers	* I think you want `sys.getsizeof`
2021-02-24 18:42:42		But it might not help like you expect.

2021-02-24 20:37:07	krbonne	Jst did a quick test.
2021-02-24 20:37:32	krbonne	getsizeof does seams to work, just like _ _ sizeof _ _ 
2021-02-24 20:38:28	krbonne	however, if you ask the memorysize of my object, .. it does not change when I add elements to the treenode.data array
2021-02-24 20:39:03	krbonne	 * however, if you ask the memorysize of my object, .. it does not change when I add elements to the treenode.data list
2021-02-24 20:39:22	krbonne	I guess this means that the object itself does not contain the list itself, but only a pointer to that list
2021-02-24 20:40:11	krbonne	but it you ask the "sizeof" or "getsizeof" of n1.data, that does grow when you add elements to the list
2021-02-24 20:43:27	moosbaue	yes seems natural to me that such a list contains only references to the list items (the nodes?)

2021-02-24 20:58:51	@brenbarn	yeah stuff like getsizeof only gets the size of the object itself which is usually not super meaningful
2021-02-24 21:02:24	@brenbarn	so like if an object has an attribute that is a list, getsizeof will still return the same size for the object no matter how big the list is
2021-02-24 21:03:08	@brenbarn	I seem to recall there are some third-party libs that try to measure object size but usually it's not worth worrying about unless you're creating gargantuan numbers of objects or you actually start to see performance issues
