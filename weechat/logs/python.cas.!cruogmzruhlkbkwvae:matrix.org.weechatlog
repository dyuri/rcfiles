2021-02-19 10:33:38	@tauoverpi	that isn't really bloat
2021-02-19 10:31:32	polygonal	I meant it as downloading stuff so you can do stuff
2021-02-19 10:31:00	@tauoverpi	so any bloat is directly your fault
2021-02-19 10:30:48	@tauoverpi	it's pretty much you building your own distro
2021-02-19 10:30:21	@tauoverpi	how?

2021-02-19 17:52:55	thelinuxguardian	Hello y'all
2021-02-19 17:53:23	nate_mif	what is the best way to list all "large" files
2021-02-19 17:53:48	thelinuxguardian	Like a terminal script?
2021-02-19 17:53:54	nate_mif	yes
2021-02-19 17:54:05	thelinuxguardian	Well what type of terminal are you using
2021-02-19 17:54:18	thelinuxguardian	like shell etc
2021-02-19 17:54:19	nate_mif	ubuntu 20.04
2021-02-19 17:54:40	thelinuxguardian	well ubuntu uses bash shell
2021-02-19 17:54:47	@tauoverpi	find + sort ?
2021-02-19 17:54:49	thelinuxguardian	idk anything about it so goodluck
2021-02-19 17:55:22	nate_mif	how do I use that?
2021-02-19 17:55:36	@tauoverpi	there's nothing special about large files
2021-02-19 17:55:50	@tauoverpi	man find
2021-02-19 17:56:00	nate_mif	allright thank you 
2021-02-19 17:56:07	thelinuxguardian	I think he means liek
2021-02-19 17:56:22	@tauoverpi	example uses are at the bottom of the man page
2021-02-19 17:56:31	thelinuxguardian	if a file is more than 8mb to be considered large
2021-02-19 17:56:53	nate_mif	something is eating up a disk and I can't find it
2021-02-19 17:57:03	thelinuxguardian	How much space do you have

2021-02-19 17:58:05	thelinuxguardian	yeah that would work
2021-02-19 17:58:05	@tauoverpi	or sort the result and so on
2021-02-19 17:59:00	thelinuxguardian	anyways y'alls opinion on mx linux?

2021-02-19 18:01:39		Does antiX = wayland? I'm a bit confused about the shtick is.
2021-02-19 18:02:22	thelinuxguardian	no
2021-02-19 18:02:31	thelinuxguardian	antiX is a debian based distro
2021-02-19 18:12:44	chuck	I would use mx over Manjaro but they don’t support snaps
2021-02-19 18:15:49	@tauoverpi	flatpak?
2021-02-19 18:23:28	chuck	A couple of apps I like don’t have flat paks last I checked
2021-02-19 18:24:49	mott	Could port them.
2021-02-19 18:25:19	mott	It's just writing package definitions right?
2021-02-19 18:25:42	@tauoverpi	can check if you find them here https://search.nixos.org/packages though not sure if you're up for using nix
2021-02-19 18:25:48	chuck	I am noob at Linux no clue how or if I could
2021-02-19 18:29:05	mott	Are the apps you want open source or proprietary?

2021-02-19 19:57:44	jkarlson	difference between which alternatives?
2021-02-19 20:07:04	cat7life	Emil Karlson: I dont understand your question
2021-02-19 20:33:18	Nhil	As in between Dolphin, Thunar, etc?
2021-02-19 20:37:12	cat7life	I meant the differance betwen a DE GUI app vs the terminal CLI
2021-02-19 20:41:38	jordan31	Interesting. I sadly can't help on that front but I'll be interested to see a speed comparison.
2021-02-19 20:44:42	cat7life	Well, for example, right now, Im copying about 15 1.5 GB sized files from my USB 3.0 BTRFS formatted drive to a UDB 3.0 NTFS formatted drive - the speed is approxx 20 MB/s
2021-02-19 20:44:42		now, before anyone starts going on about the NTFS-Fuse system, and how 'slow' ntfs is to read/write to under linux - i will quite clear here
2021-02-19 20:44:42		I have done my own tests my my Intel Quad-Core - 3.40GHz per-core, 15 GB DDR3 RAM PC wit btrfs only file systems, and i have been very dissapointed in the speeds
2021-02-19 20:45:41	themagicalcats	Also another thing, I had files corrupt from copying from a ntfs drive
2021-02-19 20:45:48	schwukas	Why would there be a difference between GUI and CLI? USB transfer speed has nothing to do with data presentation.

2021-02-19 20:49:29	cat7life	Look inbetwen the brackets
2021-02-19 20:50:24	schwukas	You want to compare transfer speeds with other Tumbleweed users?
2021-02-19 20:54:31	cat7life	Well, that would not be a bad idea itself, but if a person wants to compare something on their own distro with other using that same distro then obviously its probably better for them to just register on their own distro forum, or maybe others via a platform such as reddit
2021-02-19 20:55:00	cat7life	But right now, Im just asking for general linux users (what ever distro they are on) to do a basic file copy test for me
2021-02-19 20:56:02	schwukas	Well, from my understanding USB transmission is the kernel's job so your distribution choice has nothing to do with it.
2021-02-19 20:58:06	cat7life	thats also my general understanding, i did look this up, i can post a link here

2021-02-19 20:59:32		https://superuser.com/questions/424512/why-do-file-copy-operations-in-linux-get-slower-over-time
2021-02-19 20:59:32		This is a known issue with the Linux kernel itself that has been known for ages, no one was tackled the issue yet.
2021-02-19 20:59:32		there is currently no fix or known work-around, aside from using Windows which increases in speed and then normalizes. I find this bug to be a very high-priority issue, but the programmers do not feel the same way. It is this bug alone that is starting to drive me away from Linux.

2021-02-20 06:18:35	shinsengumi	well the bug is more inlined with the kernel
2021-02-20 06:18:43	shinsengumi	so as long as you are not using a kernel that has the bug, you're good

2021-02-20 06:49:26	cat7life	Shinsengumi: Im considering that very real and distinct possibility that due to the free-up issue under DE's (maybe only x11 ones ?), that maybe the USB speeds were deliberately dumbed down to prevent DE lockdowns - at least until the real underlying cause/issue was addressed

2021-02-20 08:11:30		I agree that having an SSD would help prevent a full and permanent lockdown of the GUI
2021-02-20 08:11:30		In my case i do have a a very fast SSD drive, but i had suffered intermittant issues under x11
2021-02-20 08:11:30		I have just upgraded to 5.21 for Wayland now, and i have noticed an incredibly fast and virtually immediate response as a result of (finally) being able to use Wayland

2021-02-20 09:10:33	cat7life	I then went to delete the folder with the files to start again after noting the start time, bu now krusader is constantly bringing up a window asking me if i want to send a file to the trash, and when i click cancel, it just keeps bringing it up again

2021-02-20 09:52:06		getting real tired of these issue real fast
2021-02-20 09:53:19	test-123	some things to take into account:   During massive copies, the first part is just written into RAM buffers, until the RAM buffers are full there is hardly IO (lazy write).  Lazy write works well for random IO as a buffer not yet written can be partly overwritten before putting it on disk. 
2021-02-20 09:53:19		It doesn't work that well for pure sequential IO. 
2021-02-20 09:53:19		This is even more the case with SLOW devices (Flash Drives, write speed, slow low RPM disks),  where there will be a speedy start (RAM Speed copies) and later when the memory buffers fill, the actual speed Device IO.

2021-02-20 09:56:07		Then don't use shitty file systems. NTFS is quite slow actually, compared to ext4 and xfs for example. Especially for many small files the performance is abysmal.
2021-02-20 09:56:16	test-123	The late start of the device IO makes it trail always. 
2021-02-20 09:56:16		rsync does slightly better as it can overlap read & writes... until there is no internal bufferspace anymore. 
2021-02-20 09:56:16		A few large files are always faster than a whole lot of small files (tar  / cpio maybe is a friend there).
2021-02-20 09:56:19	cat7life	What's the differance between cp and rsync
2021-02-20 09:57:02	@helix	Different programs 😂

2021-02-20 09:57:32		I know about cache and buffers but what has that got to do with slow copy speeds compared to Windows?
2021-02-20 09:57:41	test-123	cp is straight copy file by file. With rsync input and output are decoupled and can be local or remote (other system) and does read both size and ly copies differences in that case. (esp. useful and developped for slow communication lines).
2021-02-20 09:58:11	@helix	cp basically only calls the file copy funcrion in the Kernel, rsync does some semi intelligent reordering and works over network and you can resume copies as it checks what has been transferred before
2021-02-20 09:58:54	test-123	unless you fsync() each write ALL file writes go to RAM and possibly after a minute go to disk... ==> the first part of the copy is to a RAM disk of (how big is the "unused" RAM? a few GB?
2021-02-20 09:59:23	cat7life	Im not interested in the different methodologies, unless one is overcoming an inefficiency which is giving slow copy's

2021-02-20 09:59:29		If it's NTFS the solution is very simple, don't use NTFS on Linux unless you 100% have to.

2021-02-20 09:59:55		Yes, that's rsync
2021-02-20 10:00:09	cat7life	Ok, will try it now
2021-02-20 10:00:21	test-123	It is the perceived speed that slows down... Firs you measure RAM diskIO speed, then you measure the real speed due to real device speed. And there is a slow decay from the WRONG first estimate to the actual speed.

2021-02-20 10:00:35		> this is NOT an NTFS issue
2021-02-20 10:00:35		You're using NTFS on Linux. NTFS-3g is a FUSE driver, which is slow by design

2021-02-20 10:02:03	@helix	dd is short for "disk destroyer", so be warned.
2021-02-20 10:03:03	@helix	dd is even lower level than cp which is lower level than rsync, in terms of abstraction

2021-02-20 10:05:46		I can also do a same test but from only BTRFS drives
2021-02-20 10:07:26	shinsengumi	I think BTRFS is slow by design compare to ext4
2021-02-20 10:07:34	shinsengumi	slow in copying files*
2021-02-20 10:08:13	cat7life	People often forget that a lot of DVD's, smart TVs etc etc only accept FAT32/exFAT/NTFS, there is no support by industrys for Ext 3/4 or BTRF

2021-02-20 10:09:05	cat7life	I personally reviewed read/write performabnce tests between xfs and BTRFS and Ext - BTRFS and xfs are very comparable in performance
2021-02-20 10:09:39	cat7life	Im going to format one of my drives as exFAT just to see what the performance is like
2021-02-20 10:10:47	cat7life	One of the reasons i chose BTRFS over ext4 or xfs is because of its snapshot ability
2021-02-20 10:11:15	cat7life	ok, i can perform rsync terminal test now

2021-02-20 10:15:41	test-123	All filesystems have there characteristics.  ext4 is in general a very reasonable design. When it comes to lot's and lot's of small files look at XFS (or reiser, although reiser in unmaintend nowadays).  BTRFS is more like ZFS. BTRFS/ZFS can be setup for buffering etc. per file in a better way.  With a lot of tools not doing that makes it only average.
2021-02-20 10:15:44	cat7life	It appeared to copy the entire folder in 1 no more than 1 second
2021-02-20 10:17:02	cat7life	yes, BTRFS is a lot liek ZFS, and if i recal correctly the main issue with ZFS from a public domain open source perspective (GNU license) was a legal issue

2021-02-20 10:17:41	cat7life	So...why did rsync work ultra/mega fast, and how can i get this sort of speed via GUI file managers ?
2021-02-20 10:17:51	cat7life	were buffers smaller ?
2021-02-20 10:17:57	cat7life	decreased caching ?
2021-02-20 10:18:26	test-123	Sun might have been willing to openup ZFS, when Oracle bought Sun that was off the table. (There is a ZFS for Linux though).
2021-02-20 10:18:37	cat7life	The Folder was 2 GB in size
2021-02-20 10:18:37		it took krusader about 2-3 mins to copy it
2021-02-20 10:18:45	test-123	Well copying 0 bytes doesn't take a lot of time.... on any system.
2021-02-20 10:19:32	test-123	IF the target already has all files with the same time stamp, same size... then rsync only compares directories... sees there are no changes and is done....
2021-02-20 10:19:33	cat7life	sorry, sounds like thats a pun, unjless your telling me, this is purely buffed as  'to write later - via CoW option of file system) ?
2021-02-20 10:20:04	cat7life	Im probably over looking this!
2021-02-20 10:20:06	cat7life	lol, sorry
2021-02-20 10:21:15	test-123	rsync tries to AVOID moving data (as that is what takes time). So it does some quick tests first.
2021-02-20 10:21:15		Try rsync to an empty directory.., it will take time.....
2021-02-20 10:22:15	cat7life	Deleted folder 1 i copied accross, rebooting pc
2021-02-20 10:38:44	cat7life	Well rsync was fine - but back to the original issue - why is windows 10 at least twise as fast over linux ?
2021-02-20 10:38:51	cat7life	file copy wise
2021-02-20 10:39:27	test-123	There is no extra copy from user-> kernel and back due to NTFS implementation in userspace.
2021-02-20 10:39:53	cat7life	thats a good point you make

2021-02-20 11:07:40	cat7life	test-123: Yes that makes sense, i also know that the safety issues around the NTFS data partition with respect to writes as also a considered factor for why the driver was kept user-space
2021-02-20 11:09:32	cat7life	btw, rsync gave me the standard approxx 38 MB/s i get with krusader file manager
2021-02-20 11:09:32		What can people here suggest to me to get at 'least' 80MB/s when copying/moving files for my USB 3.0 HDD's - what file system would you recommend ?
2021-02-20 11:09:32		because i thought that using BTRFS on one of my external usb 3 drives would be like ultra fast
2021-02-20 11:09:36	cat7life	but, its' not
2021-02-20 11:10:39	shinsengumi	how was your test with exFAT?
2021-02-20 11:11:03	cat7life	even with BTRFS i usually only average about 38 Mb/s, it might start out really realyl fast (like say 100 MB/s) but it always sows down to the 38 Mb/s over about 20 seconds

2021-02-20 11:15:45	test-123	in general: probably ext4.  ... If you want to do a raw write speed test then take the Filesystem out of the equation. Copy some large file sequentially to a drive using dd.  for a REAL speed test use /dev/zero as a source... (writing all zero's might be unwanten though the drive might be optimized for this)  using /dev/random might cause hangs due to to much reading on the random device..... so /dev/zero should be considered first.
2021-02-20 11:15:45		Then you know the BEST your hardware combo can do. USB3 is a part of the equation, the drive rotation speed, internal buffering etc are another. 
2021-02-20 11:15:45		15K disks are a LOT faster than 5400 RPM disks. and USB drives might even be slower to conserve power.
2021-02-20 11:16:37	test-123	Use dd with sync option to prevent a buildup of lazy IO delay.
2021-02-20 11:17:39	cat7life	what is dd ?
2021-02-20 11:17:52	shinsengumi	its a linux utility/program
2021-02-20 11:18:00	cat7life	that does ?
2021-02-20 11:18:19	shinsengumi	open your terminal
2021-02-20 11:18:21	shinsengumi	type
2021-02-20 11:18:22	shinsengumi	man dd
2021-02-20 11:19:20	test-123	dd is a raw block copier man dd can explain if the usb is /dev/sdz then use:
2021-02-20 11:19:20		dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdz bs=1M count=100 oflags=sync
2021-02-20 11:19:50	test-123	(It WILL wipe your /dev/sdz disk.....!!!!). Yo need to repartition and reformat it.
2021-02-20 11:19:57	cat7life	ok, so you want me to benchmark the disk ?

2021-02-20 11:20:46	test-123	If you want to get that FACTS about IO speed, you need to establish the base line. It will NEVER get better than raw speed.
2021-02-20 11:20:47	cat7life	i actualyl typed it in and ran it
2021-02-20 11:20:47		then but i got 0 ifeeedback, so i quiclly stopped it

2021-02-20 11:21:39	@oj	You'll probably want to use status=progress or pipe it with pv to actually get any feedback. dd is quiet by default.
2021-02-20 11:21:45	@oj	Another option is to look at iotop.
2021-02-20 11:21:51	cat7life	so why dont i just run linux benchmarking software instead of terminal commands

2021-02-20 11:22:15		cp /dev/zero /dev/sdz works too (but doesn't have built-in progress, that's the real reason to use dd)
2021-02-20 11:22:20	test-123	if you compare a ferrari to a trabant  the trabant will NEVER reach 120 Kmpu, the Ferari will Never park in a parking slot of 1.8m wide  so it depends what you want to compare.
2021-02-20 11:22:48	cat7life	sorry - i think my question was  fair one
2021-02-20 11:22:56	test-123	cp also has limited blocksize spec.   For flash based disks 1M blocks are important.

2021-02-20 11:57:50	test-123	There are various assumtion on the underlying hardware... Some disks use 512B block, some use 4KB blocks, for others like Flash the eraseblock size is about 1MB.
2021-02-20 11:57:55	cat7life	do you have any opinion of how this can be achieved, i recall in the old DOS days one could could do
2021-02-20 11:58:16	cat7life	Well, its about my own efficiency here
2021-02-20 11:58:37	test-123	Seeing that the blocksize is at least a multiple of the real disks will help a lot, as for all other IO a block needs to be read first updated and then written back.
2021-02-20 11:58:39	cat7life	the good balance to achieve on a given file system
2021-02-20 11:58:56	cat7life	so what do you suggest i do ?
2021-02-20 12:00:53	test-123	during mkfs use the paramters to adjust blocksize... Large blocks will save IO and filesystem allocation speed, and waste a lot of space into "unused"  file tails.... a 1B file will still take a full disk block.   with 512B block 511 bytes of waste.   with 1MB blocks the 1B file has 1MB - 1B of wasted space.
2021-02-20 12:02:32	cat7life	Hmm, but surely the amount of waste for a given block size would depends upon the FS archtecture design ?
2021-02-20 12:02:45	cat7life	etx vs btrfs
2021-02-20 12:02:58	cat7life	 * etx4 vs btrfs
2021-02-20 12:03:05	cat7life	 * ext4 vs btrfs
2021-02-20 12:03:33	cat7life	file system efficiency taken into account for block free space aloocation ?
2021-02-20 12:03:41	test-123	not really   most filesystems don't handle 1/2 , 1/4 size blocks. 
2021-02-20 12:03:41	cat7life	 * file system efficiency taken into account for block free space allocation ?
2021-02-20 12:03:51	cat7life	Hmm
2021-02-20 12:04:33	cat7life	you know, assuming i can end up calculating all this maths to get a total summery idea of waste, it could be worth it
2021-02-20 12:05:36	cat7life	I have 7 USB 3 HDDS - and each one has one of the same size (to ideally be a 100% guaranteed backup/duplicate)
2021-02-20 12:06:01	cat7life	i have literally got TONS of GB to move around - speed is essential
2021-02-20 12:06:07	cat7life	ok
2021-02-20 12:06:32	cat7life	test-123: I would like to thank you for spending the time with me here - and being patient as
2021-02-20 12:06:37	cat7life	👍️
2021-02-20 12:06:46	test-123	Some fielsystems use bitmaps for freespace, others use  a block containing a list of other free blocks.. (this index block will also be reused and is still part of free space. 
2021-02-20 12:06:46		Unused space at the end of files is NOT considered in most filesystems.
2021-02-20 12:06:46		There are some Unix filesystems that can use the file tails by sharing them between files.... Inducing extra overhead in searching for them and when a file gets extendedn you will endup with some blocks still having holes...  Nice feature when disks cost $100.000 / 10MB unit.
2021-02-20 12:06:55	cat7life	OJ: The same thanks to you also

2021-02-20 12:33:57	@oj	My turn. I just got a Startech 2 port USB 3 ExpressCard and when I put it in all I get is that my CPU use goes up and the card doesn't work.
2021-02-20 12:36:41	@oj	I've never used ExpressCard and that empty slot was making me feel empty, so I had to fill it up. I got a serial ExpressCard and that works just fine.
2021-02-20 12:36:49	cat7life	question: is it using an NEC chip ?
2021-02-20 12:37:01	cat7life	Ohh, so ok then
2021-02-20 12:41:48	@oj	Actually, looks like I got it working the first time I inserted it in there looking at dmesg.

2021-02-20 12:50:51	cat7life	I just need to know if mounting a FS a certain way with parameters is in anyway relevant to speed ?
2021-02-20 12:51:29	cat7life	OJ: would you try a LIVE CD/DVD distro (any one) just to check if the device is recognised by them
2021-02-20 12:51:54	@oj	Don't have the resources to do that currently, ha.
2021-02-20 12:52:40	cat7life	resources ?
2021-02-20 12:53:02	cat7life	I mean, you could use a usb flash drive instead
2021-02-20 12:53:12	@oj	One option I have is building a less security-minded kernel. I'm using Linux with hardened patches. It could put a grip on the DMA access of some things, but I have a feeling it could be a hardware issue in a way. My ExpressCard slot is very tight, kinda too tight. I don't know if it's supposed to be that way because I got this laptop used.

2021-02-20 13:03:05	@oj	If I had a toolkit, I might open up the laptop and look if the card slot is bent in any way. The card slot door can't close properly for example. It gets stuck on some piece.

2021-02-20 13:14:39	test-123	any error message can be an issue and if it can be fixed this simple then fix it... there is a reason why there is a complaint.., something now doesn't work as expected.. if the fall back is group 0: only root has rights, if it gets -1, -2 noone on the system has access. 
2021-02-20 13:20:18	test-123	wrt. the device and security... do you use usbguard  to prevent inadvertant use of plugable devices? (to plant viruses, rootkits, fake networks etc.).
2021-02-20 13:20:42	test-123	then the kernel MAY see a device and not act on it.
2021-02-20 13:21:56	test-123	usbguard allows to block plugging any unknown device. Untill a device is "allowed" it won't be activated.
2021-02-20 13:22:51	@oj	I'm aware of usbguard. Don't have it right now.
2021-02-20 13:24:01	cat7life	test-123: Your knowledge base is impressive
2021-02-20 13:24:27	test-123	just hang around a few years and yours will be as well.
2021-02-20 13:25:21	test-123	just keep wondering how stuff works etc.
2021-02-20 13:25:33	cat7life	well i do just have one last question to complete my database of what i was discussing before
2021-02-20 13:25:33		do you see the mount command with blksize as an option i should consider
2021-02-20 13:25:35	test-123	and what is below the surface.
2021-02-20 13:26:14	cat7life	I wonder all the time how stuff works, Im analytical in nature, but i dotn have the memory capaciy (me) i need!
2021-02-20 13:26:24	test-123	mount with blocksize?..., mkfs.whatever -b xxx might.
2021-02-20 13:26:51	cat7life	my NTFS drives have 4096 as a blksize in the mount in /etc/fstab
2021-02-20 13:27:23	cat7life	so i was wondering about mount options after for the file systems
2021-02-20 13:30:13	test-123	ntfs has no blksize parameter... fuse does though.
2021-02-20 13:30:14	@oj	Funny, laptop is way more responsive while building a program with 4 cores maxed out than when I have that ExpressCard inserted.
2021-02-20 13:30:46	@oj	I might check the BIOS also after I make some system edits.
2021-02-20 13:30:56	cat7life	what if i mount ntfs with a higher blksize then ??
2021-02-20 13:33:14	@oj	I don't think you can mount it with a higher blocksize. You need to format the whole drive again to change the filesystems blocksize.

2021-02-20 13:35:13	test-123	NTFS is optimized for Windows and Windows is optimized for NTFS. 
2021-02-20 13:36:40	test-123	Linux can be tuned to some specific workload, like (dis)allowing DIRECT writing to disks for applications that need it (think DB managers, and handle their own internal filesystems, synchronisation etc).
2021-02-20 13:38:03	cat7life	yes, but gthe point is that im making here, is that it's possible to re-mount HDDs with a different block, i have seen this done online, peopel have said they have had an increase in effeciancy
2021-02-20 13:38:07	@oj	Why use NTFS anyways if we have proper exFAT support now?

2021-02-20 13:38:28	cat7life	Yes, Im going to check exFAT support very soon
2021-02-20 13:38:32	test-123	Default is to buffer anything to give an fast initial (& short) response , for sustained load this doesn't help though.
2021-02-20 13:38:32		It does help with humans behind keybards though as the system can do IO in the background afterwards.
2021-02-20 13:40:29	test-123	Well if it is "claimed on-line" then try for yourself and TEST TEST TEST also corner cases with disconnects etc. and see what the damages is and how recovery works.  Personally i trust "on-line resources"  as far as i can prove to myself.
2021-02-20 13:40:39	cat7life	True, i will play with the mounting option and do some general experiments
2021-02-20 13:40:39		In the past i have had 100% guaranteed sustained non-stop copy/move speeds copying files from my USB HDD's (happened when i upgraded form kernel 5.7 to 5.8-rc1)

2021-02-20 13:47:24	@oj	Dayum, a 4TB drive. Never had a disk that big.
2021-02-20 13:47:33	@oj	I know there's even bigger drives now.
2021-02-20 13:48:10	cat7life	I got it on a $40.00 reduction price at JB-HiFi neat christmas because noel leemings had a 4TB drive on special
2021-02-20 13:48:25	cat7life	i also have a 6TB USB 3.0 HDD
2021-02-20 13:48:37	cat7life	Hmm
2021-02-20 13:49:11	cat7life	App Disks which im using to format the drive is claiming it will take 9 hours to format it
2021-02-20 13:49:36	cat7life	seems a tad long, but i am doing the 'real deal' format - not a quick format
2021-02-20 13:50:06	cat7life	125.5 MB/s
2021-02-20 13:50:11	jkarlson	to be honest imo quick format is the real format and the long thing is erase and format
2021-02-20 13:50:14	cat7life	 * 120.5 MB/s
2021-02-20 13:50:48	cat7life	quick format literally only plants down the relevant FS data at the correct track/sector/block points
2021-02-20 13:50:52	jkarlson	there is nothing that's not of proper format in a quick formatted fs normally
2021-02-20 13:50:54	test-123	Quick format should be sufficient, no need to write all block with 000's 
2021-02-20 13:51:04	test-123	only the structural blocks.
2021-02-20 13:51:38	jkarlson	I guess exception is ext4 that does lazy formatting, where it does not even properly initialize all metadata by default
2021-02-20 13:51:42	test-123	FAT tables & root directory.
2021-02-20 13:52:07	jkarlson	I guess formatting still happend frequently enough to make that reasonable price to pay
2021-02-20 13:52:12	cat7life	Hmm, i wanted to be absolutely sure simply because i have nevr used the exFAT FS on linux before, i if there was any lapses in the driver, it might get confused with pre-existin gdata from th ecurrnet FS on the drive - Im not taking that risk
2021-02-20 13:52:40	cat7life	 * Hmm, i wanted to be absolutely sure simply because i have never used the exFAT FS on linux before, i if there was any lapses in the driver, it might get confused with pre-existing data from the currnet FS on the drive - Im not taking that risk
2021-02-20 13:53:32	cat7life	thats why im making the drive 100% "clean" everywhere before laying down that new FS
2021-02-20 13:53:32		Normally i would never perform a full format
2021-02-20 13:53:40	test-123	most probably low level format does little more than fill all blocks with 00's  modern drives dont; write trackmarks etc. from the bus. You probably also need special hardware tooling to actually format tracks...
2021-02-20 13:53:47	jkarlson	considering what's the directory metadata to data ratio on exfat, I don't think that's likely
2021-02-20 13:54:18	cat7life	I never format drives as a rule, but when i do format one, assuming the same FS i have already used, then yes, under those circumstances, i perform a quick format
2021-02-20 13:54:30	jkarlson	but theoretically there could be a bug like that
2021-02-20 13:54:34	@oj	I haven't used exFAT on Linux yet, either. Just don't have anything that needs it.
2021-02-20 13:55:20	cat7life	This is one of the genuine modern physically "small" portable drives, so it will go with me to/from peoples places
2021-02-20 13:55:37	jkarlson	does contemporary mainstream GNU+linux already use the kernel exFAT by default or the fuse option?
2021-02-20 13:55:48	cat7life	while all my other Western Digital USB HDD's are the big desktop ones, you know, that ones that need their own power supply
2021-02-20 13:56:02	jkarlson	I know the driver has been there for some time, but not all distros run recent kernels
2021-02-20 13:57:32	cat7life	Im going to check my package manager on that

2021-02-20 13:59:02	cat7life	Im assuming this is the opensuse exFAT support
2021-02-20 14:04:59	jkarlson	if you did not install those yourself, it seems your distro does probably not even use the kernel driver
2021-02-20 14:05:43	cat7life	I did not install anything exFAT related
2021-02-20 14:07:14	test-123	fuse-whatever.... runs in usermode  (non kernel drivers) those always involve extra copies.

2021-02-20 14:09:43	cat7life	https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/19099/is-exfat-slower-than-ntfs/9
2021-02-20 14:09:43		ExFAT will look slower than NTFS because NTFS assumes it's on a permanent disc and so can take its time to actually write data blocks because you won't pull the plug on it. ExFAT makes the opposite assumption.
2021-02-20 14:09:43		IIRC there's a setting that tells an NTFS volume it's a removable one so windows will stop writecaching the volume, but bugger if i can remember where that setting is......

[⋮] From a practical standpoint, the use of B-trees means that the directories are essentially "self-sorting". There is a bit more overhead involved when adding files to an NTFS directory, because they must be placed in this special structure. However, the payoff occurs when the directories are used. The time required to find a particular file under NTFS is dramatically reduced compared to an unsorted linked-list structure--especially for very large directories."

2021-02-20 14:12:13	cat7life	What about 1 single PCI-e slot USB card with multiple USB 3.0 ports
2021-02-20 14:12:58	test-123	It probably has ONE hub.

2021-02-20 14:13:25	cat7life	I do use a 7 port USB hub - 4 of those ports are USB 3.0

2021-02-20 14:14:28	cat7life	yes, bus sharignm but hoq do you know it's nessessarilyl half the speed, keep in mind that USB 3 unlike USB has extra data lines, and is Asynchronious, usb 2.0 is only synchronous

2021-02-20 14:16:00	test-123	if the bus runs at top speed for one disk, it can only interleave the others. unless there is idle time on the bus or the busses are separate.

2021-02-20 14:16:53	test-123	having 2 interface connectors can be a cable to one controler in the middle of the board... 
2021-02-20 14:17:31	cat7life	I read on the net that a lot of manufacturers that put multiple USB 3.0 ports beside each other means that your not going to get the wanted speeds because of them all sharing the same line
2021-02-20 14:17:40	test-123	if there is a separate adapter, then it has for sure it's own path.
2021-02-20 14:18:04	cat7life	That would this would be skull duggery/deception by industry
2021-02-20 14:18:49	cat7life	Well, the question then is for a given USB chip used in PCI-e cards, wether it has good quality load balancing between all currently in-use USB devicves
2021-02-20 14:19:07	cat7life	or as you say 'interleaves' between them
2021-02-20 14:19:11	test-123	you can see it in the RaspberryPi... 2, 3 had fast ethernetcontrollers to USB converter. so effective speeds was only the speed of the SINGLE central USB bus on the chipset. (shared by all USB devices and (by definition the ethernet controller).
2021-02-20 14:20:23	cat7life	but why would that not then half half the speed ?
2021-02-20 14:20:26	cat7life	link ?
2021-02-20 14:20:38	test-123	Not really as the USB is meant to be used shared..., the problem might be nog all equipment can run sustained loads on full speed uninterrupted, that needs more design & care then is available in most commodity hardware. 
2021-02-20 14:21:21	test-123	USB is like ethernet, it uses packet switching to transfer data. 
2021-02-20 14:21:53	cat7life	Unless i can confirm the efficiency of this with my own intel motherboard, then i cant tell
2021-02-20 14:21:53		But...in the end, its only about getting speeds i have had under windows with the "same hardware" Im using now for linux
2021-02-20 14:22:18	test-123	So you can send packet from A->B / packet A->B / packet A-> B or... packet A->B / packet A->C / packet A->B etc.

2021-02-20 14:27:03	cat7life	When i have performed some tests - I might consider ploking in the PCI-e card i have - and try seeing if copy/moves are better with it

2021-02-20 14:30:22		Which means Send Read command to A, Receive data block from A,  Receive result from A send Command to B, send data to B receive result from B.... many times over all on the same wires. (I should have said USB behaves like Half duplex ethernet).

2021-02-21 15:32:15	nvfanonlah	Ok i had a problem in the github there is this repo called ondir
2021-02-21 15:32:26	nvfanonlah	I tried to build it
2021-02-21 15:33:00	nvfanonlah	With the help of some fedora user they guided me to properly follow the guide and make and install it.because i am new
2021-02-21 15:33:24	nvfanonlah	But i just do not understand what code, or so called automation it does
2021-02-21 15:34:10	nvfanonlah	I tried cd here and there does not seems to trigger anything.i also kinda do not understand what is the ondir program looking for.
2021-02-21 15:35:21	nvfanonlah	I also tried various names and log in log out
2021-02-21 15:36:20	nvfanonlah	To attempt refresh terminal.and i just do not understand what is the key thing to use.
2021-02-21 15:37:21	nvfanonlah	When cd ondir is called but i do not see effect .i mean of course .because i do not have script and i do not know where to put and what name.

2021-02-21 16:21:09		Well, you can do so. The point is that if they ask directly "I'm having a problem with X where I've tried 1, 2, 3 and think it might have to do with K but I'm not sure" then you wouldn't need to commit to answer it and can answer if you know the answer.

2021-02-22 23:45:14		It's been almost 24 hours now and it's only 50% complete with 3TB of files. I know for a fact that 90% of those files were already backed up. Any idea why it's choosing to re-write all of these files to the destination? That's what it appears to be doing. I've run into issues like this in the past with rsync. Am I misunderstanding that it's supposed to only update files to the destination that have changed since the last sync?

2021-02-23 20:36:12	theyglowinthedark	mfw I need to use a google account for school
2021-02-23 20:36:30	thebuzzing	Buy a nice domain, throw it on migadu, have your own email. ;)

2021-02-23 20:37:13	thebuzzing	I still have google, cos you know, youtube. I wish ANYTHING else would take off, but nothing seems inclined to yet.
2021-02-23 20:37:39	polygonal	I only use the email for yt, I am considering blasting it now that you say that
2021-02-23 20:37:59	polygonal	mixer hehe
2021-02-23 20:38:01	thebuzzing	This reminds me, sr.ht just released their answer to github pages I think. Maybe I'll swap over.
2021-02-23 20:38:15	theyglowinthedark	isn't mixer owned by Micro$oft though?
2021-02-23 20:38:20	theyglowinthedark	idk let me check again

2021-02-23 20:38:49	polygonal	oh maybe, I dont remember
2021-02-23 20:39:05	theyglowinthedark	I don't make videos or anything so there is no reason for me to have a yt account
2021-02-23 20:39:23	polygonal	oh well google had many more things that fell flat
2021-02-23 20:39:49	thebuzzing	I like peertube, and lbry is alright, but there's not a whole heap of content other than really out there stuff, and a lot of french creators. Which is great, if you speak french.

2021-02-23 21:17:31	@oj	Good thing we have mpv and youtube-dl because I can no longer use NewPipe after having switched to the PinePhone.
2021-02-23 21:18:51	@oj	Still haven't completely switched. That Android phone has those few last things I gotta clear out.
2021-02-23 21:19:05	@oj	I wanna throw it against a wall.
2021-02-23 22:00:47	thebuzzing	I will be so happy when they figure out the mms issues on the pinephone.
2021-02-23 22:01:35	thebuzzing	It's the last hold out for me. I need to be able to do MMS, or my family will disown me for being unable to see the pictures of their kids they need to send me via that for some reason.
2021-02-23 22:02:08	@oj	Oh, ha.
2021-02-23 22:02:23	@oj	It's getting worked on right now.
2021-02-23 22:02:49	thebuzzing	Yeah, Honestly, the work all those linux phone people have done already is mind blowing.
2021-02-23 22:02:57	@oj	I've never had working MMS on a phone.
2021-02-23 22:03:13	@oj	I'd expect that to work on my Android, but nope.
2021-02-23 22:03:54	@oj	I'd expect it to get security updates, too, but that's too much apparently.
2021-02-23 22:03:59	@oj	I wanna burn it.
2021-02-23 22:04:51	thebuzzing	I think most people in the rest of the world tend to just use whatsapp or facebook or something along those lines. But for some reason no one in my family will use anything other than sms and mms. I'm sorta okay with that in regards to not swapping to facebook, but it does mean I have to keep a working phone.
2021-02-23 22:05:30	thebuzzing	I wanted to push them all to matrix, but they just looked at me like I'd mentioned maybe rewiring the starship enterprise so that it did the same thing it already did.
2021-02-23 22:06:00	@oj	I've made my family very aware that I'm not taking that bullshit. I'm giving them my own personal Nextcloud some time in the near future.
2021-02-23 22:06:27	@oj	And I'm enforcing 2FA. B)
2021-02-23 22:06:41	@oj	Suck it family. You're gonna be secure whether you like it or not.
2021-02-23 22:06:57	thebuzzing	Hah. I'm not important enough for that, they'll just stop talking to me altogether.
2021-02-23 22:07:09	thebuzzing	In some cases, that might be a blessing.
2021-02-24 09:01:12	artifth	Put everything in `unsafe` and disregard standard library 
2021-02-24 09:01:41	centi	C# for prototyping, will translate to DLang once I have implementation done.
2021-02-24 09:01:41		Custom allocators, the end-user can implement their own allocator and extend the implementation of the library.
2021-02-24 09:01:53	centi	And already using tons of unsafe code in C# lol
2021-02-24 09:02:45	centi	To give you an idea what it looks like:

2021-02-24 09:03:22		DLang
2021-02-24 09:05:21	centi	Basically the goal is this:
2021-02-24 09:05:21		Finish C# GUI Library
2021-02-24 09:05:21		Translate C# GUI Library to DLang
2021-02-24 09:05:21		Expose all required API in DLang to Foreign Function Interface via C API
2021-02-24 09:05:21		Write bindings for various languages like Python, Ruby, C++, Java, and so forth
2021-02-24 09:05:22	@tauoverpi	since part of it uses GC
2021-02-24 09:05:34	centi	Yup
2021-02-24 09:06:14	 *	@tauoverpi wonders if centi has used zig (unrelated to this)
2021-02-24 09:06:28	 *	@tauoverpi  * wonders if centi has used zig (unrelated to this but related to dlang)
2021-02-24 09:06:49	centi	I've heard about it, it's similar to Rust if I remember right
2021-02-24 09:06:59	centi	Syntax-wise
2021-02-24 09:08:22	@tauoverpi	I wouldn't say it is apart from fn f(type) type and the usual if, while, for, etc
2021-02-24 09:08:57	@tauoverpi	There's less of it
2021-02-24 09:09:00	centi	Got it, just haven't got the time to experiment other programming language yet since I've been tight on time for a while.
2021-02-24 09:09:13	centi	Though ironically, I specialize on Compiler Researches
2021-02-24 09:09:44	centi	It's my niche to work on compiler, much less on graphic programming as silly as it sounds, I initially create GUI toolkit, because I wanted to create more visualizer for creating compilers.
2021-02-24 09:11:15	@tauoverpi	sounds reasonable
2021-02-24 09:15:01	centi	Basically if I make GUI much easier to create on Linux, that would largely change the perception about Desktop Linux in general since we can pretty much start gui-ifying various applications
2021-02-24 09:21:33	centi	Another thing I forgot to mention is that, I also can support EGL-based GUI since that would helps with the installer step for Linux Distros. (EGL basically let you create GUI on Linux without running XServer or Wayland compositor.)
2021-02-24 09:22:33	artifth	Installers run X11 fine for the most part
2021-02-24 09:22:42	centi	Yeah
2021-02-24 09:23:00	centi	EGL is particularly easy to use though, so it's one of those thing that doesn't hurt to try.

2021-02-24 09:32:02	predator8bit	Can anyone explain why is there better android emulation for windows than for Linux itself? I mean running arm apk-s on x86 so anbox is a nogo
2021-02-24 09:33:02	centi	Probably due to the company prioritizing the most popular platforms than the least popular, desktop Linux. There shouldn't be any technical barrier to port Windows software over to Linux if they tried.
2021-02-24 09:33:51	predator8bit	I mean Android is linux so porting the win emulator would be a really roundabout way

2021-02-24 09:38:33		> apk-s on x86 so anbox is a nogo
2021-02-24 09:38:33		There isn't? Android implies much more than just a regular system and without GPU passthrough it's slow
2021-02-24 09:45:48	predator8bit	But on windows you have things like ldplayer which you just install and then can play android games on the pc. Seems counter intuitive to me that it works that much better on an alien platform
2021-02-24 10:06:27	artifth	desktop linux is as much alien to android application as windows is

2021-02-24 10:40:31	predator8bit	So should I expect similar performance out of google's android emulator?
2021-02-24 10:55:14	@tauoverpi	iirc that one is based on QEMU
2021-02-24 10:55:43	@tauoverpi	not sure of the performance of the upstreamed work though
2021-02-24 10:55:44	predator8bit	Yeah I read it is faster than genymotion which uses virtualbox
2021-02-24 10:56:44	predator8bit	Truth be told I couldn't get genymotion up and running as virtualbox keeps whining about signing kernel modules
2021-02-24 10:57:23	predator8bit	Haven't used it in a long time since I discovered virt-manager
2021-02-24 12:48:30	predator8bit	And I can't get the android studio sdk to work, just throws java exception errors. Starting to think I might actually need to use an android device for running apps
2021-02-24 13:21:03	jkarlson	I think people are putting a lot more effort into packaging anbox nowadays
2021-02-24 13:21:17	jkarlson	since GNU+Linux on phone is really a thing nowadays

2021-02-24 13:43:09	shinsengumi	one made from a chinese company
2021-02-24 13:43:13	shinsengumi	so yeah 100% trust there
2021-02-24 13:47:12	predator8bit	Anbox is nice but on x86 you cant run arm apps with it

2021-02-24 13:47:41		Which one is that?
2021-02-24 13:48:55	kimapr	if you want to run arm apps on x86 only an emulator would work
2021-02-24 13:48:58	kimapr	no exceptions

Drew De Vault, a lead developer with a number of open source projects such as sway, regards this move as a loophole. Both these projects were licensed under a copy-left licence, which uses copyright to protect contributions, yet the CLA negates the usefulness of copyright in achieving this protection:

2021-02-25 17:07:44	@oj	You have to update youtube-dl rather often because Youtube makes changes to their website.

2021-02-25 17:37:42	@oj	What system are you on, that it still uses Python 2?
2021-02-25 17:38:01	cat7life	opensuse tumbleweed, and yes, i know how 'funny' that sounds, irony
2021-02-25 17:38:21	cat7life	I think they are about to officially phase it out soon

2021-02-25 18:01:41		it being bound to a physical location makes it easier to figure out who if they visit more than once
2021-02-25 18:02:00	@tauoverpi	and if there isn't sufficient traffic
2021-02-25 18:02:39	cat7life	Obviously one could spy yes, or Maybe setup a camera
2021-02-25 18:02:50	polygonal	at that point you can just burry a flash drive into dirt and tell the other where to find it

2021-02-25 18:05:48	@oj	Not without risk, but a random USB stick is definitely less secure than that.
2021-02-25 18:06:18	@oj	Or that SBC is compromised and has worms in it.

2021-02-25 18:08:10	@tauoverpi	also, more cameras + logging activity
2021-02-25 18:08:27	polygonal	the most secure thing is to not do any of this, still better than a random usb?

2021-02-25 19:29:54	@tauoverpi	terrible as you want to deploy services with configuration not the configuration on it's own
2021-02-25 19:31:08	@tauoverpi	it'd also have to be overrideable which in most cases you'd want to derive a config rather than just import and go

2021-02-25 19:31:33		well current package managers only work on a file by file basis
2021-02-25 19:31:33		etcd, ansible and dotfiles managers are completely manual and not mixable

2021-02-25 20:33:27	gwilliams	Hi all, hoping somebody can point me in the right direction. I have a Debian server that I installed Synapse and Coturn on. I never got coturn to work properly, calls rarely connect successfully
2021-02-25 20:34:23	gwilliams	I read that it is because Turn does not work behind Nat. As a hobbyist, I don't know much on how to fix this. I do know my ISP gives me a handful of static IP addresses
2021-02-25 20:34:41	gwilliams	But since my entire network is currently set up behind a NAT, how do I just assign one single VM this public IP address?
2021-02-25 20:34:54	gwilliams	Is there a term or something I can search to figure this out?
2021-02-25 20:35:13	gwilliams	Searching "how to give a VM a public IP address" isn't helping me much, or else I'm just not understanding the results
2021-02-25 20:35:20	gwilliams	I have an OpenWRT router if it matters
2021-02-25 20:35:42	voice06	sounds like you want port forwarding
2021-02-25 20:36:15	gwilliams	Well that's what I've been trying up to now, trying to port forward the ports I need for Turn, but that hasn't been working
2021-02-25 20:37:02	gwilliams	<image.png> [https://office.codeandsoda.hu:443/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/NvxuyzUGboVJKoqJefKpUVHO]
2021-02-25 20:37:03	gwilliams	From https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/docs/turn-howto.md
2021-02-25 20:38:24	gwilliams	These are the rules I have currently to port forward
2021-02-25 20:38:27	gwilliams	<image.png> [https://office.codeandsoda.hu:443/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/NqAQHXpUoWfNixIukmCBALUI]
2021-02-25 20:39:35	voice06	so it looks like if you're behind NAT you're sorta SOL when it comes to TURN
2021-02-25 20:39:06	gwilliams	But yea I guess I need to try giving this server a public IP and strop trying to do port forwarding. I just have no idea how to give this VM a public IP
2021-02-25 20:40:12	gwilliams	Aren't like 99% of people with home Internet behind a NAT lol
2021-02-25 20:41:23	voice06	I'm sure they're not running a turn server though
2021-02-25 20:40:23	gwilliams	How would any hobbyist self-hoster do this then
2021-02-25 20:41:03	gwilliams	My ISP does give me some public IPs to use, I just don't know how to assign one specific virtual machine a public IP and leave everything else as is
2021-02-25 20:42:00	voice06	depending on how the VM is hosted you can do routed bridging
2021-02-25 20:44:03	gwilliams	Using a linux qemu/kvm/libvirt hypervisor

2021-02-25 20:47:08	wt	Or do layer 2 bridge and assign VM interface and WAN, configure IP in VM
2021-02-25 20:50:04	gwilliams	ok, i'll check into that and try to learn how to do one of those options
2021-02-25 20:50:23	gwilliams	it'd be great to finally get turn working. i've had synapse for a couple years and had given up on using it for calls
2021-02-25 20:50:50	gwilliams	one thing i don't quite understand, doesn't jitsi automatically configure its own turn server? why does jitsi work perfectly on my network?
2021-02-25 20:50:59	gwilliams	even though my jitsi server is also behind nat
2021-02-25 20:51:29	gwilliams	i'm only half convinced that getting a public ip will fix my synapse turn server issues
2021-02-25 20:51:43	gwilliams	there's still part of me that thinks calls just don't work well with synapse

2021-02-26 10:43:04		i do most of my stuff in a terminal, but if I have to (like using a messenger for work) then I use X/wayland along with the app that I need to use to use it
2021-02-26 10:43:17	shinsengumi	besides there are terminal emulators out there like kitty
2021-02-26 11:16:49	brutusmcforce	Tiling wms are great for us who use the terminal a lot but still wants to use some GUI apps
2021-02-26 11:18:55	Nhil	Emacs at the TTY? :) Distraction free, featureful, you could always run a minimal X server for your gui stuff
2021-02-26 11:19:54	brutusmcforce	I must admit I've used emacs for a total of maybe 5 minutes, and I've been using Linux for ~25 years
2021-02-26 11:20:55	Nhil	That's fine :)
2021-02-26 11:21:11	brutusmcforce	A friend is totally into it though
2021-02-26 11:21:34	Nhil	I was just trying it at a TTY out of curiosity (I usually use it with X) and I can see why it is the way it is
2021-02-26 11:21:49	brutusmcforce	I just find vscode really good for larger projects, and use vim for smaller stuff
2021-02-26 11:22:42	 *	@tauoverpi:feneas.org finds that if vim isn't enough then the structure of the project is wrong
2021-02-26 11:24:13	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	and needs to be restructured
2021-02-26 11:24:16	Nhil	I don't particularly find the file/project brower of VSCode very helpful, though when I did use it I did appreciate a lot of the plugins
2021-02-26 11:24:20	brutusmcforce	vscode has great stuff for quick refactorings etc. It's just easy to navigate. Maybe I just suck at vim. I use ctrlp and buffers for quick navigation here and there, but for refactoring I haven't found a way to do it as smoothly as in vscode
2021-02-26 11:24:57	brutusmcforce	Nhil ctrl+tt is where it's at
2021-02-26 11:25:09	Nhil	But that's because many editors for Windows just suck
2021-02-26 11:25:35	brutusmcforce	Yes
2021-02-26 11:25:52	Nhil	Also, the terminal in VSCode is so slow, that compiling Rust projects too exponentionally longer
2021-02-26 11:26:14	Nhil	So I ended up just using it as a glorified notepad
2021-02-26 11:26:27	Nhil	But now I'm at home I can Linux all day (for the most part)
2021-02-26 11:26:42	brutusmcforce	I have only just started dabbling with rust, using the racer (or rls, can't remember but it's the good one) plugin
2021-02-26 11:26:58	brutusmcforce	With vscode

2021-02-26 18:49:35	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	I think the only thing I use when it comes to it is workspaces and rarely tile (probably as I use a laptop)
2021-02-26 18:49:59	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	with an average of 3 windows open (kitty, qutebrowser, ...)
2021-02-26 18:51:37	thebuzzing	I like the workspaces, and the tiling. So I can jump to various apps just by a keyboard combo.

2021-02-26 18:55:43		that will work but i'd rather dumpster dive something c2d or newer for 'free' and have better performance or expansion space
2021-02-26 18:55:48	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	I did as anything else would just result in high CPU usage on the toughbook I had once. KDE and GNOME were too heavy with XFCE not being that great for it either
2021-02-26 18:56:15	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	then it stuck
2021-02-26 18:57:37	wt	yeah i can relate to that. it's either bloat-ish and usable or TWM. maybe fbdev some day
2021-02-26 18:58:30	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	I mean, it's the same time I tried using the framebuffer for everything, fbterm, etc 
2021-02-26 18:59:10	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	along with playing with directfb
2021-02-26 19:02:38	wt	links2 with fb is fun. i think i had a webkit browsing 'working' at some point. it was very fragile
2021-02-26 19:05:36	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	at that point though you haven't gained much over running plain X
2021-02-26 19:06:33	wt	X is like systemd though
2021-02-26 19:07:48	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	wayland then
2021-02-26 19:07:56	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	at least there you have isolation
2021-02-26 19:08:19	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	you can use river or other wlroots based implementations
2021-02-26 19:09:21	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	it's less code

2021-02-26 19:35:02	jkarlson	just to clarify, sway is a wayland compositor implementation, there is no wayland server like there is xorg

2021-02-26 19:36:23	wt	wayland is a good start but it's still overdoing one simple purpose

2021-02-26 19:43:58	artifth:feneas.org	compositing application windows is not simple nor easy

2021-02-26 20:07:29		it's nothing new and purism is known for their scams while the pinephone was pretty much a first effort from pine64 that didn't boast about security like purism did
2021-02-26 20:08:04	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	The rest of that blog is the same kind of content which echoes what others have said
2021-02-26 20:09:46	jkarlson	there are a lot of valid points there, but then again owner controllable phone is not as trivial to do with secure/measured boot
2021-02-26 20:10:08	jkarlson	definitely GNU+Linux needs a lot of hardening, not sure if flatpak can help a bit
2021-02-26 20:10:54	jkarlson	you can harden it yourself quite alot and that way you really do get security by obscurity
2021-02-26 20:12:44	@tauoverpi:feneas.org	and with the pine having known hardware bugs which were clear long before release... I don't see why it needs to be included there as a "point" against linux phones
2021-02-26 20:12:51	jkarlson	for laptop it's easier, but not done for eg. pbp
2021-02-26 20:13:08	jkarlson	which hw bugs?
2021-02-26 20:14:31	jkarlson	and yes there are 2 mixed things, owner controllable phones vs. mainstream phones and android vs. GNU+Linux
2021-02-26 20:15:14	jkarlson	you could easily run GNU+Linux with secure+measured boot on mainstream phone, if you drivers etc. in order

2021-02-26 20:24:01	jkarlson	also annoying that they point to firewire DMA as proof that usb is not isolation
